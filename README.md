## PlaceBook

>This repository has the API code for the main PlaceBook project: https://github.com/MiguelNiblock/PlaceBook-App

### The app to save your life's places

PlaceBook aims to be an easy-to-use tool for bookmarking, organizing and accessing locations in a map. It is motivated by the lack of existing tools to accomplish this, and by the need being so ubiquitous. Although similar features are offered by existing apps (Like Google Maps, or other navigation apps), their interfaces prioritize other features, making it inconvenient to manage or customize saved pins. The ultimate goal of PlaceBook is to become a social media platform that revolves around places.
